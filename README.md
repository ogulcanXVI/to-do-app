## **ðŸ“Œ Technologies & Concepts Used**  

In this project, I aimed to use **Redux** for state management and applied the following JavaScript concepts:  

### **ðŸ”¹ Redux & State Management**  
- **Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`)** â€“ Used to manage global state efficiently.  
- **`createSlice`** â€“ Created a slice (`toDoSlice`) to define reducers and actions.  
- **`useSelector` & `useDispatch`** â€“ Retrieved state and dispatched actions in components.  
- **Reducers & Actions** â€“ Handled actions such as adding, removing, and toggling tasks.  
- **Middleware & LocalStorage Sync** â€“ Persisted tasks in `localStorage` using `useEffect`.  

### **ðŸ”¹ React & JavaScript Fundamentals**  
- **React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)** â€“ Managed local state and performed side effects.  
- **Event Handling (`onClick`, `onChange`)** â€“ Captured user interactions.  
- **Array Methods (`map`, `filter`, `find`)** â€“ Manipulated task lists dynamically.  
- **Destructuring & Spread Operator (`...`)** â€“ Managed state updates immutably.  
- **Conditional Rendering (`&&`, Ternary Operator `? :`)** â€“ Displayed tasks based on state.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Browser APIs & LocalStorage**  
- **`localStorage.setItem` & `localStorage.getItem`** â€“ Stored and retrieved tasks to persist data.  
- **`JSON.stringify` & `JSON.parse`** â€“ Converted objects to strings and vice versa.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Performance & Optimization**  
- **Memoization (`useSelector` usage)** â€“ Prevented unnecessary re-renders by selecting only required state.  
- **Efficient State Updates in Redux** â€“ Used `immer` (built-in with Redux Toolkit) to mutate state safely.
